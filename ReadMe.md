# Advent of Code Challenge

[***AoC information here***](https://adventofcode.com/)

Advent of Code is an annual coding challenge for the Advent season (Dec 1-24).

Coding primarily in Python and in Jupyter Notebooks. Just for fun and practice, not necissaryly for bloodthirsty win-or-be-damned competition. Going at my own pace.

Years competed:
