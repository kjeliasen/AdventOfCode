    "<p>You notice a strange pattern on the surface of Pluto and land nearby to get a closer look. Upon closer inspection, you realize you've come across one of the famous space-warping mazes of the long-lost Pluto civilization!</p>\n",
    "<p>Because there isn't much space on Pluto, the civilization that used to live here thrived by inventing a method for folding spacetime.  Although the technology is no longer understood, mazes like this one provide a small glimpse into the <span title=\"So really, this puzzle is more archaeology than math, right?\">daily life of an ancient Pluto citizen</span>.</p>\n",
    "<p>This maze is shaped like a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus\">donut</a>. Portals along the inner and outer edge of the donut can instantly teleport you from one side to the other.  For example:</p>\n",

    "<p>This map of the maze shows solid walls (<code>#</code>) and open passages (<code>.</code>). Every maze on Pluto has a start (the open tile next to <code>AA</code>) and an end (the open tile next to <code>ZZ</code>). Mazes on Pluto also have portals; this maze has three pairs of portals: <code>BC</code>, <code>DE</code>, and <code>FG</code>. When on an open tile next to one of these labels, a single step can take you to the other tile with the same label.
